### *Synthetic Division and Newton Method*
In algebra, synthetic division is a method of performing Euclidean division of polynomials, with less writing and fewer calculations than occur with polynomial long division. It is mostly taught for division by binomials of the form
```
x âˆ’ a
```
but the method generalizes to division by any monic polynomial, and to any polynomial.

#### Example
f(x) = x^4 - 5 * x^3 - 34 * x^2 + 56 * x + 192 , x0 = -1

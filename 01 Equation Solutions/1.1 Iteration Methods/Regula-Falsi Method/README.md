### *Regula-Falsi Method*
In numerical analysis, the false position method or regula falsi method is a root-finding algorithm that combines features from the bisection method and the secant method.
Regula falsi method to find the roots of a function.
A method of calculating an unknown quantity by first making an estimate and then using this and the properties of the unknown to obtain it. Also known as rule of false position.

#### Example
f(x) = 10 * e^(-x/2) * (cos(6*x) + sin(8*x)) , [a, b] = [-1, 2]
